<p><h1>Merge Sort O(nlogn): </h1>Merge Sort is a popular sorting technique which divides an array or list into two halves and then start merging them when sufficient depth is reached.
<h2 >Multithreaded Merge Sort  : </h2>Multithreaded Merge Sort is an optimization of the standard merge sort algorithm that utilizes multiple threads to divide and conquer the sorting task.</p> 


<p><h1>Benefits : </h1> 1. Increased Performance
By utilizing multiple threads, the workload is distributed across multiple CPU cores. This parallel processing reduces the overall execution time, especially for large datasets. <br><hr>
2. Scalability
The algorithm can scale with the number of available CPU cores. As the number of cores increases, the sorting process can become more efficient, making it suitable for modern multicore processors. <br><hr>
3. Efficient Resource Utilization
Multithreading ensures that the CPU resources are utilized effectively, minimizing idle time and enhancing throughput.<br><hr>
4. Handles Large Data Efficiently
Multithreaded merge sort can process larger datasets faster than a single-threaded version, making it ideal for applications requiring high-performance sorting of large arrays or files. <br><hr>
5. Real-World Applications
Common in database management systems, big data processing frameworks, and real-time analytics where sorting operations are frequent and performance is critical.<br><hr>
